## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the code and report for Lab 2 of the “Speech and Natural Language Processing” course at NTUA, focusing on **sentiment analysis**. We explore classical attention models, Transformer architectures, and fine-tuning of pre-trained models on two datasets:  
- **MR** (Movie Reviews)  
- **Semeval** (Twitter sentiment) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Key goals:  
1. Implement and compare custom Attention/MultiHead/Transformer models.  
2. Experiment with hyperparameters (number of heads, layers, pooling, dropout).  
3. Fine-tune Hugging Face sentiment models and evaluate on both datasets.  
4. Prototype sentiment classification prompts using ChatGPT. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
