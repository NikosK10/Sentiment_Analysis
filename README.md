## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains the code and report for Lab 2 of the ‚ÄúSpeech and Natural Language Processing‚Äù course at NTUA, focusing on **sentiment analysis**. We explore classical attention models, Transformer architectures, and fine-tuning of pre-trained models on two datasets:  
- **MR** (Movie Reviews)  
- **Semeval** (Twitter sentiment) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Key goals:  
1. Implement and compare custom Attention/MultiHead/Transformer models.  
2. Experiment with hyperparameters (number of heads, layers, pooling, dropout).  
3. Fine-tune Hugging Face sentiment models and evaluate on both datasets.  
4. Prototype sentiment classification prompts using ChatGPT. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This project created as part of the course "Voice and Natural Language Processing" at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, NTUA and the aim of this work is NOT to present it as my personal research but as my approach to the problems given.

Special thanks to my fellow student, Georgios Tzamouranis (https://github.com/giorgostzamouranis) , with whom I collaborated for the implementation of this project.
